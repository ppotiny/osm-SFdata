Open Street Map (San Francisco, CA)

This is the link:

The region I will be discussing is called San Francisco, but contains various cities in the east, west and north bay as well.

I originally chose this map thinking that it was only San Francisco, CA. I chose it because it's a popular tourist spot, it's very close to my hometown, 
and I go there to visit friends once in a while. Even though the map region ended up covering more than San Francisco, I decided that it was a good choice 
because it covered a good portion of the bay area but did not touch the region that I was most familiar with.
